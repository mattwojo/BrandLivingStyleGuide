Brand Living Style Guide: What is it?
======================================
The Living Style Guide is a library of modular components that can be easily reused by any Devs working on the site. The site is architected to make changing colors, fonts, grid systems, etc. as simple as updating a single variable. The modules are organized into semantically named and easily understood files and folder structures. 

This Living Style Guide incorporates:

* CSS using concepts of a SMACS architecture. (Isolating concepts like typography, forms, components, layouts, etc ...)

* Uses Sass and Sass Modular Architecture concepts

* Contains a view that exposes each key foundation of the UI

* Contains a view to highlight each component

* Contains functional JavaScript  components

* Highlights the code / syntax underlying for each CSS/HTML/JS file that makes up that component

* Built in a Node/Express development environment, utilizing Angular

* Built with a 4-person Dev team over 4 days utilzing Agile Project Management methodology (Kanban Boards via Trello, 
  3-item WIP limit, daily morning stand-ups, pair programing, and swarming to improve story completion and progress through obstacles)
